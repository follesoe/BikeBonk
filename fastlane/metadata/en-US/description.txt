Never drive into the garage with bikes on your roof again!

BikeBonk is a simple app that helps you remember when bikes are mounted on your car's roof rack. With bold visual warnings, home screen widgets, Apple Watch support, and Siri integration, you'll always know your roof status before it's too late.

FEATURES

• Bold Visual States
Full-screen color-coded display makes the status impossible to miss. Green means safe, red/orange means bikes are mounted.

• Home Screen Widgets
Add interactive widgets to your home screen. See your status at a glance and toggle it with a single tap. Widgets also appear in CarPlay, giving you a clear reminder right on your car's dashboard when you start driving.

• CarPlay Dashboard Integration
Your BikeBonk widget shows up in CarPlay, so you'll see your bike status the moment you connect your iPhone to your car. A perfect last-chance reminder before pulling into the garage.

• Apple Watch App
Check and toggle your bike status directly from your wrist. Perfect for when you're loading or unloading bikes.

• Watch Complications
Add BikeBonk to your watch face for instant status visibility. Supports circular, rectangular, inline, and corner complications.

• iCloud Sync
Your bike status syncs automatically between your iPhone and Apple Watch via iCloud. Change the status on one device and see it update everywhere.

• Siri Voice Commands
Just say "Check bikes in BikeBonk" or "Bikes mounted in BikeBonk" to check or update your status hands-free.

• Shortcuts Integration
Build powerful automations with the Shortcuts app. For example: "When I open my garage, remind me if bikes are mounted."

• Privacy Focused
All data syncs through your personal iCloud account. No third-party servers, no tracking, no account required.

Perfect for cyclists, families with bike racks, and anyone who has ever had that heart-stopping moment of almost driving into a low clearance with bikes on the roof.
